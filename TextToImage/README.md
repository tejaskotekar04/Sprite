Libraries Used: Utilizes diffusers (by Hugging Face), torch (PyTorch), and PIL for image handling and neural inference.
Model Integration: Implements Stable Diffusion v1.4, v1.5, and SDXL for generating high-quality images from text prompts.

Pipeline Setup-:
Uses StableDiffusionPipeline and AutoPipelineForText2Image to load pretrained models.
Configures models to run efficiently using FP16 precision and GPU acceleration (CUDA).

Image Generation-:
Supports batch generation of multiple images using prompts (e.g., Batman in a cyberpunk setting).
Uses image_grid() to neatly arrange outputs in a grid format.

Model Variants-:
Stable Diffusion v1.5: Fine-tuned on aesthetic datasets for better visual quality.
Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL): Advanced version offering more detail and subject focus using a two-stage process.

Controlled Outputs-: Enables deterministic image generation using a manual random seed.

Use Case-: Ideal for applications in AI art generation, prompt-based illustration, or creative visual content creation.
