Developed a machine learning model to predict diabetes based on medical parameters using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. 

Built an interactive prediction system to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on user input.   

Implemented feature engineering by standardizing medical features such as glucose level, BMI, blood pressure, and insulin levels. 

The dataset contains 8 clinical features-: Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function and Age 

The dataset contains around 768 records.
